With the help of clinical examples, the authors present chapters covering the hypothesized causes of depression, including genetic and biological factors, life stress, family, and interpersonal contributors to depression. The third edition extensively updates prior coverage to reflect advances in the field. The presumed causes of depression from both a biological perspective as well as from social and cognitive perspectives are explored in detail. Two chapters explore the most recent developments in pharmacological and biological interventions and in psychological treatments, as well as the prevention of depression. This new edition includes updated discussion about challenges in research, including heterogeneity and diagnosis of depression and proposed solutions, as well as the efficacy and availability of treatments. Authored by experts in the field who are active researchers and clinicians, Depression provides a state-of-the-art primer for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students, clinicians, professionals, and researchers seeking a broad reference task that critically evaluates research into depression.",

These basic foundational understandings on the neurobiology underlying the disorder, along with a comprehensive summary of the most recent advances in research are combined in this book to aid advanced students and researchers in their understanding of MDD. Depression is one of the most common mental-health disorders caused by a variety of genetic, biological, environmental and psychological factors. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is typically treated with first-line antidepressant agents that primarily target monoamine neurotransmission. However, only approximately one-third of patients with MDD achieve remission following a trial with such an antidepressant. Furthermore, MDD is a heterogeneous phenotype, and new frameworks, such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) may provide a more accurate, biologically based comprehension of the symptomatic heterogeneity of this devastating illness. Aids readers in understanding major depressive disorder in the context of NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) recommendations Covers a range of existing and potential pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment options, from lifestyle adjustments, to antidepressants and novel therapeutics Synthesizes discussions on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying symptoms with the clinical aspects of depression",
